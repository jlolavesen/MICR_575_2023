# Joins

1. Imagine youâ€™ve found the top 10 most popular destinations using this code:
```{r}
top_dest <- flights |>
  count(dest, sort = TRUE) |>
  head(10)
```
How can you find all flights to those destinations?

```{r message=FALSE}
top_dest_flights <- top_dest |>
  left_join(flights) |>
  select(dest, carrier, flight)

glimpse(group_by(top_dest_flights, dest))
```

# Functions

2. Write a function to 'rescale' a numeric vector by subtracting the mean of the vector from each element and then dividing each element by the standard deviation. 

```{r}
rescale02 <- function(x) {
  ((x-mean(x))/sd(x))
}

rescale02(c(0:10))
```
